#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/publish-release.sh — tag this tree and publish its build output as a
# GitHub Release, which is how the compiled libraries travel between machines.
#
#   scripts/publish-release.sh <tag>            e.g. scripts/publish-release.sh v9.0.2-1
#   scripts/publish-release.sh <tag> --allow-dirty   (skip the clean-tree check)
#
# Steps: refuse a dirty tree (the tag must name EXACTLY the source that built
# output/) → create + push an annotated tag at HEAD → package output/
# (scripts/package-release.sh) → `gh release create` with the tarball + its
# .sha256 → print the pin line for the app's gradle.properties.
#
# Needs the GitHub CLI, logged in (`gh auth login`); the repo is private, so the
# app-side fetch needs the same login. Run this on the machine that built the
# libraries; afterwards any other machine gets them with a plain clone + gradle
# sync of the app (see firedown/docs/NEW-MACHINE.md).
