# firedown/

This directory contains everything Firedown adds on top of upstream `ffmpeg-android-maker`. Nothing here exists in `Javernaut/ffmpeg-android-maker` — keeping it isolated means upstream merges won't conflict with our changes.

## Two kinds of changes

This fork has **two categories** of modifications, handled differently:

### Category A: Changes to the `ffmpeg-android-maker` repo itself (committed in this fork's tree)

These are modifications to files that live in this repo's source — not in FFmpeg's source. Committed directly in their modified form:

| File | What changed | Documented at |
|---|---|---|
| `ffmpeg-android-maker.sh` | Hook to invoke `apply-firedown-patches.sh` | `firedown/patches/0001-...patch` |
| `scripts/ffmpeg/build.sh` | Firedown configure flags (`--enable-jni`, protocol/muxer trim, etc.) | `firedown/patches/0003-...patch` |

The patches in `firedown/patches/` for these are documentation only — they're already applied in this fork. They exist so:
- A reader can see at a glance what was changed and why
- If upstream rewrites these files in a future merge, the patches can be re-applied (or `install-firedown-hook.sh` can do it for `ffmpeg-android-maker.sh`)

### Category B: Changes to FFmpeg source (applied at build time)

These modify files inside the FFmpeg source tree, which is downloaded fresh each build. They cannot be pre-committed because the FFmpeg source isn't part of this repo:

| FFmpeg file | What changes | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `libavformat/http.c` | Full replacement with OkHttp JNI backend | `firedown/replacements/libavformat/http.c` is copied over at build time |
| `libavformat/hls.c` | Remove `open_url_keepalive` code paths | `firedown/patches/0002-...patch` is applied at build time |
| `configure` | Add `http_protocol_deps="jni"` and `https_protocol_deps="jni"` | `apply-firedown-patches.sh` uses `awk` to insert the declarations |

`apply-firedown-patches.sh` is invoked by the modified `ffmpeg-android-maker.sh` after FFmpeg source is downloaded but before any per-ABI build runs. It performs all three operations idempotently.

## Initial setup

If you've just forked this repo, the only thing you need to do before the first build is **generate the real hls.c patch** against your target FFmpeg version:

```bash
# Outside the repo
wget https://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-8.1.tar.xz
tar -xf ffmpeg-8.1.tar.xz

# Inside the repo
./firedown/scripts/generate-hls-patch.sh /path/to/ffmpeg-8.1
```

The placeholder file at `firedown/patches/0002-hls-c-remove-keepalive-branches.patch` will be overwritten with a real, applying patch. Commit it.

After that, normal builds via `./ffmpeg-android-maker.sh` will pick up Firedown's modifications automatically.

## When upstream changes

If `Javernaut/ffmpeg-android-maker` releases a new version and you want to merge:

1. Pull upstream into your fork (`git pull upstream master` after adding the upstream remote)
2. Resolve any conflicts in `ffmpeg-android-maker.sh` and `scripts/ffmpeg/build.sh`. If overwriting them is easier:
   - Re-run `./firedown/scripts/install-firedown-hook.sh` to put the main script hook back
   - Manually re-apply `0003-build-sh-firedown-configure-flags.patch` to `scripts/ffmpeg/build.sh`
3. If FFmpeg version was bumped, regenerate the hls.c patch via `generate-hls-patch.sh`
4. Test build end-to-end before tagging a release

## When the hls.c regex stops matching

If `generate-hls-patch.sh` warns "block not found", upstream FFmpeg has rewritten the affected regions of `libavformat/hls.c`. Open the script, locate the regex patterns (clearly commented), and update them to match the new code. The patch generator is forgiving of context drift — it does the work of producing a real diff once it can find the blocks.
